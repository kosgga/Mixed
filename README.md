## What is Big O Notation?


Big O Notation and Time Complexity are ways of discussing how long an algorithm is going to take 
**O irepresents function
**(n) represents the number of elements

1.O(1):Static amount of time<br>
2.O(logn):Divide and conquer type of algorithm like binary search<br>
3.O(n):Directly and linearly linked with N<br>
4:O(nlogn):Merge Search<br>
5.O(n<sup>2</sup>):Checking a list<br>
6.O(infinity):flipping a coin<br>
