## What is Big O Notation?


Big O Notation and Time Complexity are ways of discussing how long an algorithm is going to take 
**O irepresents function
**(n) represents the number of elements

1.O(1):Static amount of time
2.O(logn):Divide and conquer type of algorithm like binary search
3.O(n):Directly and linearly linked with N
4:O(nlogn):Merge Search
5.O(n<sup>2</sup>):Checking a list
6.O(infinity):flipping a coin
